# Majora's Mask Randomizer Item Tracker

## Content

This is a pack for EmoTracker designed for Majora's Mask Randomizer, it is available for download in the [EmoTracker application](https://emotracker.net/).
EpicYoshi helped me develop the Map Tracker.

## Variants

The pack offers three different variants:

1. **Map Tracker**: complete map tracker to pin and check locations, we decided to keep Clock Town separated from the rest of Termina
2. **Standard**: item tracker which contains most of the items in the game
3. **Minimal**: item tracker which only contains key items for progression towards dungeons completion

## Clarifications

If you have doubts on what a certain icon represents, hover your mouse on it for some seconds and its name will pop out.

* **Standard** layout has six items set to active as default, this is based on Deathbasket's randomizer starting items (Sword, Shield, Ocarina, Magic, Song of Time and Song of Healing).

* ![Woodfall Skulltulla](http://puu.sh/CLLLk/d86abe03e1.png) / ![Great Bay Skulltulla](http://puu.sh/CLLKX/70c5dda9f0.png) are to keep track respectively of Woodfall skulltullas and Great Bay skulltullas.

* You can right click songs to mark which song checks you have done. This is useful when songs are just shuffled between them.

* Small keys for Woodfall Temple and Great Bay Temple don't have a counter because they both contain only one, you either mark them or not.

* You can cycle through bottle items, I purposely omitted two or three items because they don't unlock any check. Having specific bottle items is only relevant when Bottlesanity is on.

* **Minimal** layout has some combined items included to show as few icons as possible which could be confusing: here is their explainations:

* ![Bombs and Blast Mask](http://puu.sh/CLLKB/9650b27006.png) is meant to be marked when you find Bombs *or* Blast Mask, since they open the same checks.

* ![Gibdo Mask and Garo Mask](http://puu.sh/CLLNE/1135257ca0.png) right click to mark Garo Mask and left click to mark Gibdo Mask. I merged these two items since they serve the same purpose in terms of progression towards a dungeon (entering Ikana Canyon).

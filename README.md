This is a pack for EmoTracker designed for Majora's Mask Randomizer, it's available for download in the EmoTracker application.

This pack will be updated based on players' feedback and usage after playing the new 2019 version of Deathbasket's MM randomizer.

# Variants

The pack offers two different variants at the moment:

* **Standard**: tracks most of the items in the game
* **Minimal**: only contains key items for progression

# Clarifications

If you have doubts on what a certain icon represents, hover your mouse on it for some seconds and its name will pop out.

**Standard** layout has five items set to active as default, this is based on Deathbasket's randomizer starting items (Sword, Shield, Ocarina, Song of Time and Song of Healing)

![Woodfall Skulltulla](http://puu.sh/CLLLk/d86abe03e1.png) / ![Great Bay Skulltulla](http://puu.sh/CLLKX/70c5dda9f0.png) are meant to keep track respectively of Woodfall skulltullas and Great Bay skulltullas.

**Minimal** has some combined items that could be confusing: here's their explainations:

* ![Bombs and Blast Mask](http://puu.sh/CLLKB/9650b27006.png) is meant to be marked both if you find Bombs *or* Blast Mask, since they unlock the same checks
* ![Gibdo Mask and Garo Mask](http://puu.sh/CLLNE/1135257ca0.png) right click to mark Garo Mask and left click to mark Gibdo Mask. I merged these two items since they serve the same purpose in terms of progression towards a dungeon (entering Ikana Canyon).

You can cycle bottle items, I purposely omitted two or three items because they don't unlock any check, this could change based on feedback.

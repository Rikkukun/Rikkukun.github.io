# Majora's Mask Randomizer Item Tracker

## Content

This is a pack for EmoTracker designed for Majora's Mask Randomizer, it is available for download in the [EmoTracker Link](https://emotracker.net/ "EmoTracker application").

This pack will be updated based on players' feedback and usage after playing the new 2019 version of Deathbasket's MM randomizer.

## Variants

The pack offers two different variants at the moment:

1. **Standard**: tracks most of the items in the game
2. **Minimal**: only contains key items for progression towards dungeons completion

## Clarifications

If you have doubts on what a certain icon represents, hover your mouse on it for some seconds and its name will pop out.

* **Standard** layout has five items set to active as default, this is based on Deathbasket's randomizer starting items (Sword, Shield, Ocarina, Song of Time and Song of Healing).

* ![Woodfall Skulltulla](http://puu.sh/CLLLk/d86abe03e1.png) / ![Great Bay Skulltulla](http://puu.sh/CLLKX/70c5dda9f0.png) are to keep track respectively of Woodfall skulltullas and Great Bay skulltullas.

* You can right click songs to mark which song checks you have done. This is useful when songs are just shuffled between them.

* Small keys for Woodfall Temple and Great Bay Temple don't have a counter because they both contain only one, you either mark them or not.

* You can cycle through bottle items, I purposely omitted two or three items because they don't unlock any check, this could change based on feedback.

* **Minimal** layout has some combined items included to show as few icons as possible which could be confusing: here is their explainations:

* ![Bombs and Blast Mask](http://puu.sh/CLLKB/9650b27006.png) is meant to be marked when you find Bombs *or* Blast Mask, since they open the same checks.

* ![Gibdo Mask and Garo Mask](http://puu.sh/CLLNE/1135257ca0.png) right click to mark Garo Mask and left click to mark Gibdo Mask. I merged these two items since they serve the same purpose in terms of progression towards a dungeon (entering Ikana Canyon).

## Questions or Suggestions

You can keep an eye on my to-do list and future ideas for the pack I wrote down in my [TODO and ideas list](../blob/master/ideasTODO.md "ideasTODO").
